## Improvements over the default nginx autoindex html

- no stupid datetime format
- better mobile experience (thanks to the `viewport` meta tag)

## How to use

- Download file `autoindex.xslt` to your server (you may rename it how you want).
- Put the content of file `location.conf` in your nginx config, **read the file and make necessary modifications first**.
